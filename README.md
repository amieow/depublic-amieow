## üßê About <a id="about" name = "about"></a>

This platform is a marketplace for buying and selling concert or event tickets.
It offers various categories of needs. Users who register on this application
can act as buyers. In this case, users are expected to easily find concert
schedules that suit their needs and pay for tickets online. Additionally, the
website is expected to provide accurate and up-to-date information about ongoing
events.

## üìÅ Folder Structure <a id="folder_structure" name = "about"></a>

   - **atoms** :
     - This folder contains the smallest building blocks of the application,
       such as buttons, inputs, and labels.
   - **organisme** :
     - This folder contains more complex components that are composed of atoms,
       such as forms, cards, and modals.
3. **contents** :
   - This folder contains the content of the application, such as text, images,
     and videos.

## üí≤ Environment Variables <a id="environment" name = "environment"></a>

#### to add environment variables you must doint this step :

1. create the `.env.local` file on the root folder
2. add this text inside the file

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   NEXTAUTH_URL=YOUR_NEXTAUTH_URL
   ```

   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` : A secret string, which can be generated using base64
     encoding.
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` : Your Google Client ID.

   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` : Your Google Client Secret.
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` : The URL of your website. For development, use
     `http://localhost:3000/`.

#### some blog maybe you need it :

- [How to get Google Client Id and Google Client Secret](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)

This process allows you to securely store and access sensitive information
required by your application. Remember not to share or expose these values
publicly to maintain the security of your application.

## üéà Usage <a id="usage" name="usage"></a>

### Running the Application Locally

To run your Next.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages by running `npm install` in your project
   directory.
2. add the environment variable
3. Build the application by running `npm run build`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the application.

For more information on running a Next.js application locally, check out the
official documentation.

## üöÄ Deployment <a id="deployment" name = "deployment"></a>

The fastest way to deploy a Next.js application is by using Vercel. Vercel
automatically detects Next.js and runs `next build` when you push your code to a
Git repository. It also optimizes the build output for you, including:

- Persisting cached assets across deployments if unchanged
- Immutable deployments with a unique URL for every commit

To deploy your Next.js application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Vercel.
2. Connect your Git repository to Vercel.
3. Configure your deployment settings, such as environment variables and custom
   domains.
4. Deploy your application.

For more information on deploying a Next.js application, check out the
[official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
